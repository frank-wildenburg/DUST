# DUST
Repository for DUST dataset of underspecified sentence types and the code used to create and study it

This work is the result of my master's thesis, "Investigations into Semantic Underspecification in Language Models", which I wrote for my master's degree in Logic under the supervision of dr. Sandro Pezzelle

The code is presented in notebooks, with code divided by purpose. In practice, I used the Snellius cluster, which often saw me run code multiple times with small adjustments. For this reason, the code occasionally needs to be changed - in these cases, I have left commented code you might need to add/delete

Code for the probing tasks is adapted from code by Jaap Jumelet and Jelle Zuidema used for the course Interpretability & Explanability in AI
