# DUST
Repository for DUST dataset of underspecified sentence types and the code used to create and study it

This work is the result of my master's thesis, "Investigations into Semantic Underspecification in Language Models", which I wrote for my master's degree in Logic under the supervision of dr. Sandro Pezzelle
